## Structure

For now the pages are divided as such:
- There is a home page that combines the intros of Diarra, Hope, and Priya.
- There is a second page that divides Diarra from the rest based on majors. All of them do computer Science but Diarra is the only one that also majors in Japense studies. As such the odd one out is Diarra. I have commented in the code whose paragraph corresponds to which human.

### Choreography

## Proposed Divison

If you want to change the structure just let me know but I propose styling the second page based on Natual Science vs. Humanities
