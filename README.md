## Structure

For now the pages are divided as such:
- There is a home page that combines the intros of Diarra, Hope, and Priya.
- There is a second page that divides Diarra from the rest based on majors. All of them do computer Science but Diarra is the only one that also majors in Japanese studies. As such the odd one out is Diarra. I have commented in the code whose paragraph corresponds to which human.

### Ontology
The Ontology currently is pretty basic. The webpages Ontology is split between Natural sciences and Humanities. The structure of the pages uses headings such as [about, work, and music]. These headings are within their respective super headings of either Natural science or Humanities.

Famous (I) will go back through and adjust the nouns representing the sections of material

### Taxonomy

#### Content
The initiative of this website is to mange the content of Hope, Priya and Diarra's individual websites by organising them based on
differing academic umbrellas.

#### User Community
The target audience is very general. The gist of the web site, two natural science approaches and one humanitarian approach, is hopefully clear to the average person to stumble across the page. To be more specific, the end users are Prof. Kostin and TA as well as other students in csc174.

### Choreography
There are three main "topics" of the website. That being, Hope, Diarra, and Priya. In order of presentation, Hope and Priya would normally come before Diarra. Hope and Priya have majors and experience that coincide with Natural Science. Diarra has a major and experience that go along with Humanities. As such Hope and Priya should be grouped together since they are similar. To be consistent I suggest having them come before content involving Diarra so said content is organised in a standard fashion.

## Proposed Division

If you want to change the structure just let me know but I propose styling the second page based on Natural Science vs. Humanities
